1.- GENERAL

* What is OmpSCR?
It is a repository of free OpenMP source codes useful for learning, testing
and benchmarking. It is offered to compiler designers, application
programmers and final users of OpenMP.

* Which programming language uses the applications in the OmpSCR?
The OpenMP API supports parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran, and
therefore, these are the languages for the applications in the OmpSCR.

* Where can I get the last version of OmpSCR?
It is available in the download section at http://www.pcg.ull.es/OmpSCR/

* What kind of applications are included in OmpSCR?
They range from very simple synthetic codes (i.e. parallelized loops with
dependencies) to real scientific applications (i.e. Molecular dynamic).
Some of them are oriented to show how to implement usual parallel paradigms
using OpenMP and others are provided to remark red-spot issues in the
implementation of OpenMP compilers (i.e. nested parallelism).

2.- INSTALLATION

* Where can I get the OmpSCR?
Visit the Download section in the OmpSCR web site:
http://www.pcg.ull.es/OmpSCR/

* Can I build the OmpSCR applications in my machine?
OmpSCR distribution has been successfully tested in several platforms (Intel,
Sun, IBM, SGI, HP). It uses GNUmake, ANSI C and standard Fortran90/95 for wide
portability. In case you find troubles to build the distribution, please
report them to ompscr@etsii.ull.es

* Do I need to define environment variables?
No

* I have decompressed the .tar.gz file and I have got several directories.
What's their meaning?
The directories in OmpSCR and their contents are as follows:
  applications: contains the applications currently in the repository
  common:       source code needed for all the applications
  developer:    files oriented to applications developers
  log:          stores log messages from compilations
  bin:          binaries for the applications once they're built
  config:       machine-dependent configuration files
  doc:          documentation
  include:      source code files included by the applications

* Once I've decompressed the OmpSCR, what should I do?
You should configure the OmpSCR using 'gmake config'.
You must do this before compiling the applications

* I have decompressed the .tar.gz file. What's the next step?
Use 'gmake' with no parameters to see the different options
 
* When I run 'make' I get some error messages
OmpSCR uses GNU 'gmake' instead of native 'make'.
GNU gmake is a standard tool (http://www.gnu.org/software/make/) that you can
compile for your own platform.

* Why 'make config' is needed?
make config indicates to the compilation scripts the paths and parameters of C
and/or Fortran90/95 compilers, because they're specific to your machine.
 
* Why 'gmake config' does not work?
You should have a bash or ash shell installed

* I can't use 'gmake config'. What should I do?
Define manually the contents in the file config/templates/user.cf.mk

* What's the format for the config/templates/user.cf.mk file?
In the same directory you have examples for several machines.
If you don't have the user.cf.mk file, you can build one from none.cf.mk.
Copy the file as user.cf.mk. It is a file with the basic structure, where
you'll have to fill the corresponding fields.

* When making the configuration, the script ask for several parameters. What's
their meaning?
You have explanations in the configuration files (*.cf.mk)

* Where can I get the information for building user.cf.mk file?
Those values are machine-dependent.
Test the parameters for your compiler.
If you don't know them, ask to your site system administrator.

* Where can I get *.cf.mk files for other machines?
You have some in ./config/templates directory.
They are also available in the download section of the OmpSCR

* I have installed the user.cf.mk file. What should I do now?
Now you can compile the different applications.
If you get problems, see the 'COMPILATION' section in the FAQ

* I want to add my own applications under my local OmpSCR structure. 
What should I do?
In the ./developer directory of the OmpSCR distribution, there is a
README.developer file, containing instructions about how to adapt your code.

* How can I take my local installation of OmpSCR to a different machine?
Use 'gmake dist' on the root directory of the OmpSCR. This will create a
compressed file containing a copy of your local OmpSCR.

3.- COMPILATION

* What should I do to compile the applications?
Use 'gmake all' in the OmpSCR directory and it will compile all the
applications

* Nothing happens when I run 'gmake all'
Verify that you are in the root directory of the OmpSCR

* When I try to compile the applications, I get many errors and warnings.
Perhaps you have not defined correctly your machine configuration. See the
'INSTALLATION' section in the FAQ.

* I think the compilation has been successful, but I can't find the binaries.

* There are two binaries (appname_seq and appname_par) for each application.
What's their meaning?
They are the sequential (_seq) and OpenMP parallel (_par) versions of the
application.

* I want to build only the sequential/parallel versions of the application
If you use 'gmake seq' or 'gmake par' It will build only the corresponding
version

* I am working with a specific application. May I build only this?
If you use gmake in the directory of the application, It will build only the
binary for that application.

* I want to delete the results of the compilations
Use 'gmake clean' on the root directory of OmpSCR

* I want to compile an application with specific compiler parameters. What
GNUmakefile should I use?
Each application has an specific GNUmakefile

* Once I've compiled the applications, how can I run them?
See the 'EXECUTION' section in these FAQ

4.- EXECUTION

* I've built the binaries for the applications. How do I run them?
The binaries are in the ./bin directory '_seq' and '_par' are the suffixes for
the sequential and parallel versions. The execution is self explanatory.

* Do the applications require any parameters for execution?
Yes. Most of them do. If you execute the binary with no parameters, you'll get
an explanatory text about the required parameters for the application.

* Which values are appropriate for the parameters of the applications?
If you run the application with the '-test' flag it will run with predefined
values for the parameters. We recommend to test the applications with these
values, but different values are also possible. You should investigate the
best suitable values for your system.

* Have you stated specific values for the parameters of the applications for
benchmarking?
At this moment, we haven't. 
In case you're interested in publishing your results with the applications in
the OmpSCR we recommend to use the parameters given with '-test' option, but
this is a matter to be discussed.

* How do I pass the parameters to the applications?
All the applications in the OmpSCR take the values from the command line.

* Do I need a parallel machine to execute the applications in the OmpSCR?
You can build and execute the sequential versions of the codes in a sequential
architecture, but if you want to run the parallel versions, you'll need a
parallel one.

* Do I need queues for parallel execution?
This is machine-dependent. Ask the system administrator in your installation.

* May I execute in background?
This is machine-dependent. Ask the system administrator in your installation.

* How do I know if my OpenMP compiler provides effective support for nested
parallelism?
This depends on the compiler itself. Ask the system administrator in your
installation.

5.- TIME MEASUREMENT

* Do I need to include timing routines in the applications?
All the applications in the OmpSCR have their own timing routines (you can see
the source code in the ./common directory).

* Which functions should I use for time measurement?
You can find them in the ompscrCommon.c (for C)  and ompscrCommon.f90 (for
Fortran90/95) in the ./common directory. The names of the timing routines are
OSCR_timer* and in the source code files you can find an explanation for each.

* I want to change the point where time measurements are made in an
application. What should I do?
Edit the application source code and change the point where you call the
OSCR_timer_start and OSCR_timer_stop functions.

* I want to change the timing routines for my system. What should I do?
The code for calling the system time routine are in the files wtime.c and
wtime.f90 in the ./common directory. We recommend that you change these files
and use the OSCR functions interface.

* When I run my application I get an error: 'OSCR Time not init....'. What's
the problem?
Before calling OSCR_timer_start and OSCR_timer_stop functions, you must
indicate the number of timers you're going to use (using the function
OSCR_timers_init). Also, you should clear the timers (OSCR_timer_clear) before
using it.

6.- RESULTS

* How can I get the execution time for the OmpSCR applications?
After execution, the applications report the elapsed time for the execution.

* What's the format for the final report of the applications?
This format is defined in the routine OSCR_report.
You can find the source code in the corresponding ompscrCommon file.

* May I compare my results with some others?
You can find results for different applications and platforms in the Download-Results
section of the OmpSCR web site.

* May I send my own results to be used by others as a reference?
Of course! Any results are welcome.
If you plan to send results you should register in the OmpSCR web site and
submit them in the 'Download-Results' section with an explanation of the
conditions of your experiment.

7.- APPLICATIONS

* The applications in the OmpSCR are 'real applications' or synthetic
experiments?
Some of the applications implement interesting scientific applications, while
others are synthetic experiments.

* I have my own OpenMP applications. What should I do to contribute them to
the OmpSCR?
In the ./developer directory of the OmpSCR distribution, there is a
README.developer file, containing instructions about how to adapt your code.
Anyway all examples of OpenMP codes of interest are welcome "as they are".
The OmpSCR team may tune the details.

* I want to use some of the applications in the OmpSCR. Am I allowed to do so?
Read the comments in the first lines for each application. Most of the
applications are under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

* Where can I find additional information about the applications in the
OmpSCR?
In the comments for each application you have references for further
information.

* I want to add my own applications under my local OmpSCR structure. 
What should I do?
See the 'INSTALLATION' section in the FAQ.

* I want to remove some applications from my local installation of the OmpSCR.
See the 'UNINSTALL' section in the FAQ.

8.- UNINSTALL

* Is there any uninstall process to remove my local copy of the OmpSCR?
No. Simply remove all the directories structure.

* I want to remove one application from my local copy of the OmpSCR.
Simply remove the corresponding directory from the ./applications directory.

* Before removing my local copy, I would like to save the configuration file.
Save a copy of the ./config/templates/user.cf.mk file.

* Before removing my local copy, I would like to save an application.
Save a copy of the contents of the ./applications/app for your app.

* I want to remove the present configuration.
Run 'gmake distclean'. This removes the present configuration. If you want to
use the OmpSCR you'll need to define the configuration again.
